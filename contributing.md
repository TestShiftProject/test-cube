# TestCube Development Setup

Here we describe the development setup for TestCube.

If you will work on the test amplification itself, you need to setup `test-runner` and `DSpot`, too ðŸ™‚

## Test Cube

1. Install IntelliJ together with the `gradle-intellij-plugin`
   plugin. (https://jetbrains.org/intellij/sdk/docs/tutorials/build_system.html)
2. Clone this repository
3. Open the root in IntelliJ! ðŸ˜„ After opening the project in IntelliJ, you can execute Test Cube with the gradle
   task `runIde`.

To test and run TestCube / DSpot you need:

- an installation of Java 11 (including the path to your Java Home)
- an installation of Maven (including the path to your Maven Home)
- an example project based on Java 11 and Maven

## Example Project

Youâ€™ll need an example project to try out DSpot/TestCube on ðŸ™‚

Currently, DSpot supports projects that use Maven and Java 8 and Java 11 (with caveats also Java 16)

One project that Test Cube works well on is jsoup: [https://github.com/jhy/jsoup](https://github.com/jhy/jsoup)

Fell free to try it on any other projects youâ€™re interested in! you can find a few more that DSpot should run on here

## Code Overview
This section intends to give a brief overview over the structure of this project to help you find the code you're looking for.

### Packages
```
src/
`-- main/
    |-- java/org/testshift/testcube
        |-- amplify
        |-- icons
        |-- inspect
        |-- misc
        |-- model
        `-- settings
```
The package `amplify` takes care of starting the test amplification with IntelliJ. Its central class is the `StartTestCubeAction` which configures and spawns the subprocess running DSpot.
The package `inspect` contains the tool window which presents the amplification results to the user (`AmplificationResultWindow`) and the custom editor implementations which present the code.
In `model` you can find data classes that symbolize the whole `AmplificationResult` and the `TestCase`s and `CoverageImprovement` used to represent the outcome of the amplification process.
`misc` collects Util and config files, `icons` points to the SVGs used in the plugin and `settings` contains everything related to the preferences section for TestCube.

## DSpot

If you will work on the amplification process itself, you will likely do this by modifying DSpot, the test amplification
tool TestCube relies on. TestCube contains a packaged jar of DSpot, so if you do changes to DSpot: repackage it and copy
it over to the test-cube repository :)

Clone from: [https://github.com/TestShiftProject/dspot](https://github.com/TestShiftProject/dspot/tree/test-cube)

Checkout the branch `master`

Build with

```
mvn package
```

If you get this error:

`Execution default-test of goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-surefire-plugin:2.12.4:test failed: The forked VM terminated without saying properly goodbye. VM crash or System.exit called ?`

solve it with an `mvn clean` and another `mvn package`

To include a new version of DSpot within Test Cube, locate the built jar with dependencies in the `target` folder and
replace the jar in `test-cube/src/main/resources/dspot`.
