# Welcome to Test Cube!
**The IntelliJ Plugin to help you automatically make your test suite better**

<!-- todo: Amplify: link to explanation? paper? -->
Test Cube *amplifies* your JUnit tests right from your IDE.

This plugin can help you automatically amplify your JUnit tests to improve your test suite 😊  
The heart of our amplification is [DSpot](https://github.com/STAMP-project/dspot).  

Find out more about our research project and how we want to help developers improve their test suites on the [TestShift project website](https://testshiftproject.github.io/visualizing-amplification).
